Funnel.js - React
=========

This is an updated version of Funnel.js. https://github.com/inlineblock/funnel.js

The difference between this one and the previous one, is this basically has no options. You send it an array of data objects with the key "value" as the number.

All other options are done by CSS. Checkout that CSS file for changing the colors, gaps, etc. Height is set automatically be the containers in CSS. It defaults to 80vh.

This was originally demo'd at #UtahJS conference.

Usage
=====
```jsx
<Funnel data={ getData() } />
```
